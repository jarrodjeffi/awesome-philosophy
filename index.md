# Introduction
The following is a highly opinionated list of what constitutes a proper reading
of Western philosophy which currently covers the Greeks up to and including the
early modern era. It should be noted that you can pick and choose your
trajectory when approaching this list. However, it could be beneficial to
approach the list in order as some philosophers make heavy reference and build
upon previous philosophers.

# History
One should read a history of Western Philosophy before they take the plunge
into primary sources. On this account Kenny's [A New History of Western
Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com.au/New-History-Western-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00ARGXJM8)
is highly recommended. An in-depth but rewarding title which not only provides
a chronological but also a thematic account of the history of Western
Philosophy. The chronological account is given first with the thematic style
introducing the logic and language, epistemology, physics, metaphysics, mind
and soul, ethics, and theology of the era.

Getting a general gist of what each philosopher you'll encounter in this list
is about is an important first step to understanding. This isn't a work of
fiction where you can get spoilers, take on all the support you need even if
that amounts to purchasing secondary sources to supplement your readings.

# Early Greeks
1. [The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and Sophists](https://www.amazon.com/First-Philosophers-Presocratics-Sophists-Classics-ebook/dp/B0064A4VUA)
2. Plato: [Complete Works](https://www.amazon.com/Plato-Complete-Works-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NMHU)

   The complete works but you don't have to read them all. To get a general
   feel for Plato it's enough to read Meno, Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito which
   is a tetralogy about The Trial of Socrates, then Symposium, Phaedrus,
   Republic, and Phaedo which is a tetralogy about the soul.

   If you really think you'll get into Plato it's best to start your journey
   with Alcibiades, Lysis, Laches, and Charmides which is a tetralogy about
   man. Following this you have Protagoras, Greater Hippias, Lesser Hippias,
   and Gorgias which is a tetralogy about the sophists. From here you can read
   the above two tetralogies about The Trial of Socrates and the soul.

   Following this there's Cratylus, Ion, Euthydemus, Menexenus which is a
   tetralogy about the spoken and written word. Parmenides, Theaetetus,
   Sophist, and Statesman is a tetralogy about dialectics. Finally Philebus,
   Timaeus, Critias, and Laws makes up the final tetralogy in the journey which
   is about the cosmos.

3. Aristotle: [Complete Works](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Aristotle-Translation-One-ebook/dp/B00JW04P64)

   One should read Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Poetics, The Organon, Physics,
   On the Soul, Metaphysics, and Rhetoric in that order. The Organon is not a
   single volume but many which includes Categories, De Interpretatione, Prior
   Analytics, Posterior Analytics, Topics, and Sophistical Refutations.

4. Epicurus: [Selected Writings and Testimonia](https://www.amazon.com/Epicurus-Reader-Selected-Writings-Testimonia-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NNH4)
