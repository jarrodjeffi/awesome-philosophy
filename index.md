# Introduction
The following is a list of what could constitute a proper reading of Western
philosophy which currently covers the Greeks up to and including the early
modern era. It should be noted that you should pick and choose your trajectory
when approaching this list. However, it could be beneficial to approach some
things in order as philosophers usually make reference and build upon previous
thought. However, if you do read Kenney's history you should be able to
approach the list from any angle.

# Sources
This list and the reading order were compiled with significant reference to:

1. [/lit/ Philosophy Project 1.2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y8_RRaZW5X3xwztjZ4p0XeRplqebYwpmuNNpaN_TkgM/pub)
2. [/lit/ wiki: Philosophy](http://4chanlit.wikia.com/wiki/Philosophy)
3. [/lit/ wiki: Charts](http://4chanlit.wikia.com/wiki/Charts#Philosophy)

Basically it's [4chan's](http://boards.4chan.org/lit/catalog) philosophy
resources with links to Kindle versions where applicable.

# History
One should read a history of Western Philosophy before they take the plunge
into primary sources. On this account Kenny's [A New History of Western
Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com.au/New-History-Western-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00ARGXJM8)
is highly recommended. An in-depth but rewarding title which not only provides
a chronological but also a thematic account of the history of Western
Philosophy. The chronological account is given first with the thematic style
introducing the logic and language, epistemology, physics, metaphysics, mind
and soul, ethics, and theology of the era.

Getting a general gist of what each philosopher you'll encounter in this list
is about is an important first step to understanding. This isn't a work of
fiction where you can get spoilers, take on all the support you need even if
that amounts to purchasing secondary sources to supplement your readings and
perhaps even reading them first.
