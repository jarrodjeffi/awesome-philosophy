# Introduction
A highly opinionated list of philosophers and their seminal works. For now this
list is those books which I have or plan to read. The distinction between the
two amounts to whether a short blurb has been given. For now the aim, for the
most part, is to list those philosophers and those works which are under two
hundred pages in length; exceptions will be noted. This, I feel, keeps the ball
rolling for beginners who want to get their feet wet but don't want to put all
their eggs in one philosophical basket.

# Overviews

## General introductions
1. Russel's [The Problems of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell-ebook/dp/B00A7LNK04)

   What is the nature of knowledge? How can we know? Is knowledge certain?
   Basically a book on epistemology that serves as a good introduction to the
   early modern rationalists and empiricists.

## Histories
1. Warbuton's [A Little History of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Little-History-Philosophy-Histories-ebook/dp/B005W9XXLW)

   Short and to the point if you just want an overview of what each philosopher
   "feels" like rather than an in-depth analysis. Favours the ethical view of
   each philosopher rather than their metaphysical or epistemological views.

2. Kenney's [A New History of Western Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com.au/New-History-Western-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00ARGXJM8)

# Early Modern Rationalists
1. Descarte's [Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Discourse-Meditations-Philosophy-Hackett-Classics-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NQIU)

   "Cogito ergo sum," along with meditations on what can be known for certain
   and why God necessarily exists.

2. Leibniz's [Discourse on Metaphysics and Monadology](https://www.amazon.com/Discourse-Metaphysics-Essays-Hackett-Classics-ebook/dp/B005IL1QMW)

   A discourse on why this is the best of all possible worlds, why God
   necessarily exists, and on monads; which you'll have to read to find out
   what they're about.

# Early Modern Empiricists
1. Berkeley's [Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous](https://www.amazon.com/Dialogues-Between-Philonous-Hackett-Classics/dp/0915144611)

   Berkeley, from the point of view of Philonous, was a strong idealist who
   believed matter was not the case but solely minds perceiving and
   interpreting the world. His God was the perfect mind that perceived all
   those things that were and were not perceived by other minds.

2. Hume's [An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding](https://www.amazon.com/Enquiry-Concerning-Human-Understanding-Gentleman/dp/0872202291)

# Early Political Philosophy
1. Machiavelli's [The Prince](https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Hackett-Classics-Niccolo-Machiavelli-ebook/dp/B003GEKKZC)

# German Idealism
1. Kant's [Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics](https://www.amazon.com/Prolegomena-Any-Future-Metaphysics-February-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NQE4)
