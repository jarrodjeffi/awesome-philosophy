# Introduction
The following is a highly opinionated list of what constitutes a proper
education in Western philosophy. It should be stated upfront that reading isn't
enough when it comes to the philosophy proper. One must engage, take notes,
write down thoughts, and ultimately learn that philosophy isn't about answers
but understanding.

It should be noted that you can pick and choose your trajectory when
approaching this list. However, it could be beneficial to approach the list in
order as some philosophers make heavy reference to previous philosophers.

It is also of note that proper Kindle editions to all these books isn't
possible and if this is the case you'll find the book without a link and in
*italics*.

# History
One should read a history of Western Philosophy before they take the plunge
into primary sources. On this account Kenny's [A New History of Western
Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com.au/New-History-Western-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00ARGXJM8)
is highly recommended. An in-depth but rewarding title which not only provides
a chronological but also a thematic account of the history of Western
Philosophy. The chronological account is given first with the thematic style
introducing the logic and language, epistemology, physics, metaphysics, mind
and soul, ethics, and theology of the era.

I know this is asking a lot upfront but getting a general gist of what each
philosopher you'll encounter in this list is about is an important first step
to understanding. This isn't a work of fiction where you can get spoilers, take
on all the support you need even if that amounts to purchasing secondary source
s to supplement your readings.

# Early Greeks
Perhaps the most brutal section you'll encounter filled with not only
philosophy but mythology, poems, and plays.

1. Hamilton's [Mythology](https://www.amazon.com/Mythology-Edith-Hamilton-ebook/dp/B00FOQRZFS)

   Retells the story of many Greek myths, and is an essential part in fully
   understanding the following philosophers. That is, many of the Greek
   philosophers based their understanding in the frame of Greek culture which
   includes its mythology.

2. Homer's [The Iliad](https://www.amazon.com/Iliad-AmazonClassics-Homer-ebook/dp/B072MQ8FL7)
3. Homer's [The Odyssey](https://www.amazon.com/Odyssey-AmazonClassics-Homer-ebook/dp/B071JBJTFY)
4. Herodotus' [The Histories](https://www.amazon.com/Histories-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-ebook/dp/B007WPNWAG)

5. Waterfield's [The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and Sophists](https://www.amazon.com/First-Philosophers-Presocratics-Sophists-Classics-ebook/dp/B0064A4VUA)

   Includes important Sophists that are mentioned in Plato's dialogues, namely:
   Protagoras, Hippias, and Gorgias. Also contains important Presocratics such
   as Parmenides and Heraclitus.

6. Plato's [Complete Works](https://www.amazon.com/Plato-Complete-Works-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NMHU)

   The complete works but you don't have to read them all. To get a general
   feel for Plato it's enough to read Meno, Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito which
   is a tetralogy about The Trial of Socrates, then Symposium, Phaedrus,
   Republic, and Phaedo which is a tetralogy about the soul.

   If you really think you'll get into Plato it's best to start your journey
   with Alcibiades, Lysis, Laches, and Charmides which is a tetralogy about
   man. Following this you have Protagoras, Greater Hippias, Lesser Hippias,
   and Gorgias which is a tetralogy about the sophists. From here you can read
   the above two tetralogies about The Trial of Socrates and the soul.

   Following this there's Cratylus, Ion, Euthydemus, Menexenus which is a
   tetralogy about the spoken and written word. Parmenides, Theaetetus,
   Sophist, and Statesman is a tetralogy about dialectics. Finally Philebus,
   Timaeus, Critias, and Laws makes up the final tetralogy in the journey which
   is about the cosmos.

7. Aristotle's [Complete Works](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Aristotle-Translation-One-ebook/dp/B00JW04P64)

   One should read Nicomachean Ethics, Politics, Poetics, The Organon, Physics,
   On the Soul, Metaphysics, and Rhetoric in that order. The Organon is not a
   single volume but many which includes Categories, De Interpretatione, Prior
   Analytics, Posterior Analytics, Topics, and Sophistical Refutations.
