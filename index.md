# Introduction
This curated list of awesome philosophical works has a few aims. The first aim
is to be amiable to beginners. That is, it should start with accessible works
and then sink into "real philosophy." The second aim is that the works should
also be accessible in the sense that they're not too long; preferably less than
200 pages. Finally, each work will be linked to the Amazon store page for two
reasons: Amazon provides electronic and print books, and the best introductions
and translations cost money.

With these aims in mind, the organisation of the list is as follows. Upfront
you'll find a beginner's section that covers introductory books and some
history to give a general overview. You'll then find the sections are arranged
in chronological order starting with mythology and the pre-socratics. Though
you can choose to start from where ever you like it's probably best to *start
with the greeks*. Most primary sources depend on previous primary sources. For
example Kant depends on Locke's *Essay*, Berkeley's *Treatise*, and Hume's
*Enquiry*.

With these aims and organisation in mind, I hope you find this list helpful.
Philosophy is a tricky beast to pin down but an enjoyable game to play
nonetheless.
