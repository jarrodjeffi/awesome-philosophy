# Introduction
A highly opinionated list of philosophers and their seminal works. For now this
list is those books which I have or plan to read.

# Overviews

## General introductions
1. Blackburn's [Think](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Compelling-Introduction-Simon-Blackburn-ebook/dp/B006XCKJOQ)
2. Russel's [The Problems of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Problems-Philosophy-Bertrand-Russell-ebook/dp/B00A7LNK04)

   What is the nature of knowledge? How can we know? Is knowledge certain?
   Basically a book on epistemology that serves as a good introduction to the
   early modern rationalists and empiricists.

## Histories
1. Kenny's [A New History of Western Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com.au/New-History-Western-Philosophy-ebook/dp/B00ARGXJM8)

   An in-depth but rewarding title which not only provides a chronological but
   also thematic account of the history of philosophy. The chronological
   account is given first with the thematic style introducing the logic and
   language, epistemology, physics, metaphysics, mind and soul, ethics, and
   theology of the era.

2. Warbuton's [A Little History of Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Little-History-Philosophy-Histories-ebook/dp/B005W9XXLW)

   Short and to the point if you just want an overview of what each philosopher
   "feels" like rather than an in-depth analysis. Works well as an alternative
   to Kenny's tome..

# Start with the Greeks
1. Hamilton's [Mythology](https://www.amazon.com/Mythology-Edith-Hamilton-ebook/dp/B00FOQRZFS)
2. Waterfield's [The First Philosophers: The Presocratics and Sophists](https://www.amazon.com/First-Philosophers-Presocratics-Sophists-Classics-ebook/dp/B0064A4VUA)
3. Plato's [Complete Works](https://www.amazon.com/Plato-Complete-Works-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NMHU)

   The complete works but you don't have to read them all. To get a general
   feel for Plato it's enough to read Meno, Euthyphro, Apology, and Crito which
   is a tetralogy about The Trial of Socrates, then Symposium, Phaedrus,
   Republic, and Phaedo which is a tetralogy about the soul.

   If you really think you'll get into Plato it's best to start your journey
   with Alcibiades, Lysis, Laches, and Charmides which is a tetralogy about
   man. Following this you have Protagoras, Greater Hippias, Lesser Hippias,
   and Gorgias which is a tetralogy about the sophists. From here you can read
   the above two tetralogies about The Trial of Socrates and the Soul.

   Following this there's Cratylus, Ion, Euthydemus, Menexenus which is a
   tetralogy about the spoken and written word. Parmenides, Theaetetus,
   Sophist, and Statesman is a tetralogy about dialectics. Finally Philebus,
   Timaeus, Critias, and Laws makes up the final tetralogy in the journey which
   is about the cosmos.

# Early Modern Rationalists
1. Descarte's [Discourse on Method and Meditations on First Philosophy](https://www.amazon.com/Discourse-Meditations-Philosophy-Hackett-Classics-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NQIU)

   "Cogito ergo sum," along with meditations on what can be known for certain
   and why God necessarily exists.

2. Leibniz's [Discourse on Metaphysics and Other Essays](https://www.amazon.com/Discourse-Metaphysics-Essays-Hackett-Classics-ebook/dp/B005IL1QMW)

   A discourse on why this is the best of all possible worlds, why God
   necessarily exists, and on monads; which you'll have to read to find out
   what they're about.

# Early Modern Empiricists
1. Berkeley's [Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous](https://www.amazon.com/Dialogues-Between-Philonous-Hackett-Classics/dp/0915144611)

   Berkeley, from the point of view of Philonous, was a strong idealist who
   believed matter was not the case but solely minds perceiving and
   interpreting the world. His God was the perfect mind that perceived all
   those things that were and were not perceived by other minds.

2. Hume's [An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding](https://www.amazon.com/Enquiry-Concerning-Human-Understanding-Gentleman/dp/0872202291)

# Early Political Philosophy
1. Machiavelli's [The Prince](https://www.amazon.com/Prince-Hackett-Classics-Niccolo-Machiavelli-ebook/dp/B003GEKKZC)

# German Idealism
1. Kant's [Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics](https://www.amazon.com/Prolegomena-Any-Future-Metaphysics-February-ebook/dp/B00OZ4NQE4)
